# Intro

React Shader Fiber (RSF) is an experimental custom React Renderer, designed to compose Fragment Shaders using a
declarative way.

## Why?

For fun, of course!

React Shader Fiber is designed to make shader programming easier and more fun. It combines the straightforward methods
of modern frontend frameworks like React with shader programming. This makes advanced visual effects and graphics
available to more developers.

## Declarative Syntax

React's declarative syntax has revolutionized UI development, allowing developers to focus on *what* they want to
achieve, rather than *how* to do it. This approach simplifies coding, enhancing readability and maintainability. React
Shader Fiber extends these benefits to WebGL shaders, providing:

- **Improved Readability:** The declarative nature makes shader code more understandable, even for those not deeply
  versed in WebGL.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Developers can quickly experiment with visual effects, seeing immediate results in a familiar
  framework.
- **Exploring:** React Shader Fiber's exciting feature is exploring new animation combinations. You can blend animations
  for unique effects, promoting experimentation and creativity.
