## Why?

For fun, of course!

React Shader Fiber is designed to make shader programming easier and more fun. It combines the straightforward methods
of modern frontend frameworks like React with shader programming. This makes advanced visual effects and graphics
available to more developers.

See [Documentation and examples](https://pavophilip.github.io/react-shader-fiber)

## Installation

          <Shader>
              {/* Child of Shader component (color) will be assigned to the result */}
              <Color hex={"#ff0000"}/>
